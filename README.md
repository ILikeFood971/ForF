This fabric mod allows you to recreate almost everything in the Friend or Foe YouTube series that has 4 members: [SB737,](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWJikipm2MTbCmHm6e9KV0bPmW6chk1j9) [ClownPierce,](https://www.youtube.com/@ClownPierce) [Quiff,](https://www.youtube.com/@QuiffYT) and [Mini](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkUQm5HBzevSUv6iW8EMErAmIKPKD4uF7). They have some alterations that differ from the regular vanilla experience. The Friend or Foe mod, forf for short, aims to add those new features and gameplay changes for you to enjoy with your friends.

## What is included

- A config that allows you to customize a lot of what is added
- A new player tracker item
- Lives system that will decrease a life until player runs out
- Restrictions
    - No villager trading
    - No golden apple recipes
    - No elytra in the end ships
    - No totems drop from evokers
- PvP Timer that runs for random amounts of time

This mod tries to follow everything written in the official Friend or Foe rules [written here](https://pastebin.com/X9j3ZsNb).

## How to use

The mod is fairly simple to use. First you must start it up at least once to generate the config file. You can then change that according to how you like it. You can ignore the bottom two options as those are used internally by the mod.

Once everything has been set to what you like, save the file. While doing this, have every player you would like to play with log on and run the `/forf join` command. Once everyone has joined, you can then run the `/forf start` command (op required) to set everything up. If at anytime you need to stop forf, run the `/forf stop` command.
