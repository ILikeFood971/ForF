## How to use

The mod is fairly simple to use. First you must start it up at least once to generate the config file. You can then change that according to how you like it. You can ignore the bottom two options as those are used internally by the mod.

Once everything has been set to what you like, save the file. While doing this, have every player you would like to play with log on and run the `/forf join` command. Once everyone has joined, you can then run the `/forf start` command (op required) to set everything up. If at anytime you need to stop forf, run the `forf stop` command.
